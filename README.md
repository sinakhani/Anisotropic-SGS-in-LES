# Anisotropic-SGS-in-LES-
This repository includes data and publications for my work on subgrid mesoscale and submesoscale eddy parameterizations in the climate system. I have recently proposed a coupled subgrid-scale (SGS) dissipation scheme in the horizontal and vertical directions for atmosphere and ocean simulations. This new model is developed based on anisotropic grid spacing in general circulation models (GCM), and it suggests that dissipation schemes for kinetic and avaialbel potential energy (KE and APE) should be coupled in the horizontal and vertical directions in GCMs in order to have less-dissipative and more accurate results at coarse-resolution armosphere and ocean simulations. Furthermore, we propose that our model will exclude the requirement of any ad hoc energyzing terms at small horizontal scales ---in the form of stochastic and/or negative viscosity backscatter--- in atmoshpere and ocean GCMs.
